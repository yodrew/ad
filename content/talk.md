#### intro

Hello, my name is Andrew Durham.  
Welcome to my talk  
hygiene of darkness: introduction to darkroom retreating

Tonight, I will tell you the basics of Hygienic darkroom retreating  

I'll take questions at the end.  
But if you do not hear something I say or if you do not know a word I use, please raise your hand and tell me.  
There is a difference between wanting to know more about something and missing the idea altogether.

#### what

- ^^ a Hygienic darkroom retreat consists of resting in an absolutely dark room for days, alone, with food.
- What is the one word in this definition that best summarizes a Hygienic darkroom retreat? Rest. 
- So it is exactly the opposite of conscious effort. 
- So it is not discipline, like spiritual practice. It is not therapy. And it is not a psychedelic trip.

What do I mean by absolute darkness?

- It is so dark that even after your eyes adjust to it for three days, you still cannot see your hand in front of your face.
- When you look around, you cannot see a haze or pinprick of light anywhere.
- Inside, there are no light sources like candles.
- And it is continuous. Uninterrupted. No breaks.

#### why do it

- for the great pleasure of resting deeply
- for relief from distress and over-stimulation of civilized existence
- to recover from fatigue and exhaustion
- to heal from psychic trauma and illness
- to finally deal with your own suffering

#### who i am

To tell you who I am, I have to teach you a new word: rapture.  

- h<span class="euro">&auml;</span>nryckning (lose yourself into something else)
- h<span class="euro">&auml;</span>nforelse (amazement)
- gl<span class="euro">&auml;</span>djerus (intoxicated with happiness)
- f<span class="euro">&ouml;</span>rtjusning (delight, admiration, appreciation for something special)

- uppryckandet Bible/apocalypse: (pull up, like weeds)
- extas (ecstasy)

Rapture is the intoxicating joy that comes from perceiving something perfect and beautiful.  
It is calm and quiet.  
It feels normal, natural, and right

- like how life really is
- how it is supposed to be all the time.

Rapture, not suffering, is the natural human condition.  
How do I know this?  
When I was 15, a feeling of rapture overcame me for three months solid.  
Then it faded.

This made no sense because it had felt so natural.  
So more than anything, I wanted it back.  
I spent 21 years searching for its cause.  
Everything else in my life I put in service to this purpose.  
Primarily, this meant my interests in philosophy, health, design, and music.  
I studied these things independently while traveling.  
I lived in poverty because, as a designer, I wanted a solution that would work for everyone.  
About five years ago, it came to me in a dream.

- The routine brutality of our civilized way of life causes major psychic trauma in infants.  
This turns us into functional psychotics.  
Not dangerous, just broken, suffering, and lost
- At 15, adolescence peaked for those &three months. 
    - Biological activity increased. 
    - This slightly increased my vital energy level. ("Vitahl enerhwee")
    - This led to partial, temporary restoration of my psychic integrity.
    - My consciousness functioned better, so I became more aware of reality.
    - Suddenly, I could perceive a little of its enrapturing perfection and beauty.
- Now, if a slight increase of vital energy caused this, then a massive increase from {darkroom retreating could cause permanent and complete restoration of psychic integrity}.
- If so, then retreating would lead to the end of our deep suffering.  
Mine and everyone else's for the last 15,000 years.  
Restored to full function, we could then quickly solve our bizarre collection of unnecessary problems.  
We could finally live in the happiness and peace so many of us have felt is possible.

By working on my little problem with the design perspective, I solved the biggest, oldest problem in the world.  
With this idea, I knew instantly that the theoretical phase of my quest was over and the practical phase had begun.  

In the past seven years I have:

- done 15 retreats of 2-6 days
- built 3 darkrooms in Guatemala and Sweden
- facilitated retreats for 25 others
- observed no data contradicting this idea.
- written about this idea for web and print, and in hundreds of emails to people all over the world, totaling over 100,000 words.
- gotten unqualified support for my idea from an internationally recognized Swedish psychologist and professor who researches the psychic effects of sensory destimulation.

#### how it works

##### what is hygiene?

When I say hygiene, what is the first word that comes to mind?  
It's true. But hygiene is more than cleanliness.  
Here is Webster's definition of hygiene:

^^conditions and practices conducive to the preservation of health, such as cleanliness. 

What other healthy conditions and practices can you think of?  
Correct. Those are all part of hygiene.

Now let's examine the second part of the definition: "conducive to the preservation of health." 

1. Conducive means making it easy, possible, or likely for something to happen or exist, tending to promote or assist, contributive to.
2. Health of what?
3. Preservation by what? What performs the preservation?

Yes. The organism preserves its own health. It is self-preserving.  

Self-preservation:

- is the defining characteristic of all organisms
- occurs at every scale: cells, organs, and systems. 
- includes self-generation, self-maintenance, and self-healing.
- healing 
    - requires more work, time, and energy than self-maintenance
    - includes
        - repair of damage
        - elimination of toxins, exogenous and endogenous
        - re-energization at every scale

Do you usually perform the preservation consciously, or do you mostly just provide conditions? Provide conditions.  
So what part of the organism generally performs the preservation? The unconscious, involuntary, autonomic part. 

The unconscious is:

- the hidden part of consciousness. It permeates the being. It is in every cell.
- the biggest part, coordinating 10 trillion cells and millions of actions per second in each one
- therefore practically omniscient and omnipotent. 
- waiting for a chance to fix what is broken in you.

Here is how darkness is that chance.

##### how Hygienic darkroom retreating works

1. The psyche is an organic system. Therefore it is self-healing.
2. The primary condition of healing is rest
3. Profound rest occurs in a darkroom retreat

Here is why the primary condition of healing is rest:

- healing requires the extra vital energy accumulated in rest
- faculties only heal fully when they are at rest

Here is how profound rest occurs i a darkroom retreat:

    1. Darkness signals the circadian system of the organism to cause sleep.  
    For example, the pineal gland, secretes melatonin into the blood. Melatonin, a hormone that makes us sleep, dream, and lose appetite.  
    In absolute darkness, melatonin and other hormones flood the system.  
    I didn't just read that.  
    I always feel soothing, cool waves of liquid spreading through my skull in darkness.  
    The biochemical aspect of the process is directly perceivable.  
    2. The psyche usually spends a great deal of energy on processing sensation.  
    In darkness, all sensation is reduced.  
    And sight, which requires more processing than all other kinds of sensation combined, is eliminated altogether.  
    So all that energy is conserved.  
    3. The abstract nature of vision feeds the abstracting mind. Without it, the mind calms down.  
        - Less thoughts occur.  
        - Thinking is more difficult. 
        - Thinking becomes less interesting because other aspects of consciousness, like feeling, become more active in darkness. 
        - Placing attention in restful places becomes *much* easier.  
    4. A retreat doesn't just provide absolute darkness, but all conditions of profound rest:  
    comfort, silence, and solitude  
    fresh air, warmth, and natural food.

This is how profound rest occurs in absolute darkness.

The hygiene of darkness is about appreciating darkness as a condition of health, especially psychic health.  
^^It is the _restful use of darkness in support of the self-healing psyche_.

#### who

Everybody can do this. Darkness is already a natural part of everyone's life.  
No extraordinary knowledge, effort, time, or money is required. 

#### what you do

What is the point of a retreat? To rest.  
So most of the time you are lying down  
Either you sleep or keep your attention in restful places  
You also eat, drink water, use the toilet, bathe, and exercise  
You might have astonishing insights, laugh, shout, cry, scream, punch the mattress, and write notes about your experience  

*drink water:* somehow darkness makes this hard to remember, so make sure it happens by measuring out 3 liters a day into bottles and drinking them down  
*exercise* do this at least 5 minutes a day and as much as you feel like

#### where

A darkroom is just a small house in a quiet location.  
It is fully functional with heating, ventilation, running water, and electricity.  
It has minimal contents, like a hotel room.  
Like all houses should be but aren't, it is perfectly and easily darkened.

#### when

A retreat begins in the evening after dinner.  
Upon arrival, you unpack and settle in.  
Your supporter shows you how the room works, reviews retreating basics, and answers any questions.  
The dark part of a 4-day retreat starts that night and continues through the next two days and nights.  
The supporter maintains the room, brings food, and says hello if wanted.  
The third morning, windows are uncovered to enable a slow transition back to regular life.  
Rest continues without company or media.  
It is a time to reflect on the retreat, take a nap, and take a walk.  
In the evening, windows are covered again for sleep in total darkness.  
The next day, the retreat ends before noon.

#### how to do it

##### generally


- hygiene: underlying theory of the restful use of darkness
- format: ways to use darkness in retreats and daily life
- protocol: what little there is to do in a Hygienic darkroom retreat
- prepare: questions to ask yourself and what to bring
- design: darkroom specifications and menu
- make: instructions for making darkroom components

#####  attitude

- look at hygiene again: what performs the preservation?
- So you just provide conditions for the autonomic self to do most of the work. The autonomic self is the star. You play a supporting role. This is actually the normal relationship we are supposed to have
- by restful, I mean the will is mostly passive while the autonomic self is active. This means a Hygienic darkroom retreat is not: 
    - discipline, which is characterized by will and effort (spiritual practice, self-development)
    - therapy, which would view darkness as a treatment, an active force that does something to the passive organism
    - a psychedelic trip, which is about consciously experiencing psychic phenomena that are normally unconscious
- all these emphasize conscious experience. The Hygienic approach emphasizes unconscious experience: the activity of the autonomic self. 
- You are not trying to achieve anything, but recover something that was lost (not enlightenment, but restoration or recapacitation).

##### attention

- on thoughts above the head
- visually inside head
- palpably (with the sense of touch) on breathing in gut
- palpably on the pulse, especially in the heart

#### dos and don'ts

##### do

- try this!
- read my book, hygiene of darkness, to avoid basic mistakes and save time. 
- if you like the experience, help make a proper darkroom happen:
    - tell me if you have or know somewhere a darkroom could be set up
    - organize or invest in one
    - build one. I will send you clients. I'll be your first.

##### don't

- imagine that just because you have heard me talk about this that now you know enough about it to do it. You must also read what I have written to really get what I am trying to say.
- worry if you feel nervous before a retreat. It's a sign that you are about to recover something that belongs to you
- expect more from a retreat than a nice break from your regular life. My most effective retreat happened when I had given up all  hope that it would help.
- finally, don't blame me if, after doing a retreat, your life is never the same again.

#### next step

Find out for yourself the benefits of resting in absolute darkness. Try this out tonight! 

- tack up blankets over your windows
- cover device lights
- fresh air
- sleeping mask

If you are not sure if you have tacks at home, take some of these that I brought for you. I recommend 4 for every window and door in your bedroom.

My name is Andrew Durham. When I am not responding to whatever is in front of me, I write, speak, and consult on everything related to Hygienic darkroom retreating.  
Please help yourself to water and fresh Iranian dates at the food table.  
Thank you for listening. Do you have any questions?

[Q&A]

I would like to sell all of you a copy of my book. If you really like this idea and want more than one, I give quantity discounts.
