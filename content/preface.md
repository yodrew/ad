What is a Hygienic darkroom retreat and why do it?

It consists of resting in an absolutely dark room for days alone with food. 

At first, I just did it to rest. It worked. After 54 hours, I felt caught up on all the sleep I had ever lost, truly awake for the first time in decades. I was stunned.

Two years later, the same thing happened. Except, unusually, I also felt humbled. Genuinely calm. _Well_ in my soul.

How?, I wondered. From Natural Hygiene, I vaguely remembered the self-preserving nature of life, and rest as the primary condition of healing. One morning in a dream, this and many related clues fused in the conception of _restful use of darkness in support of the self-healing psyche_. 

I began testing this idea in more darkroom retreats. As predicted, lethal psychic issues that have tortured me my whole life began resolving themselves spontaneously. In seven years and 16 retreats, I have seen no sign of an end to this process---short of full recovery of psychic integrity.

The investigation has barely begun. But I have seen enough to confidently share what I have learned: what happens in darkness, why, how to retreat, and what for. This approach is ripe for more participation, resources, and velocity. 

Hygienic darkroom retreating requires minimal effort and no faith. Darkness is not the absence of light, but the presence of the self. It is yours.
