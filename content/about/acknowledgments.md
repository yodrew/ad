title: "acknowledgments"

First and foremost, for making the book real, thanks to my editors,

- Are Solheim, writer and fellow refugee in darkness, for seeing and believing in me and the book, visionary editing, and hosting me during the rewrite
- Magnus Vanebo, philosopher, for support, enthusiastically diving into the text, and sensitive editing

In triage, you were as merciful as you could be.

And to Bertrand Besigye, poet and fellow journeyman in darkness, for early support of the book

Then, hundreds of people in eight countries on two continents personally made my life and work possible by morally and materially aiding me during my prodigal search. To name but a few:

My family, immediate and extended. I leaned on all of you that would let me. It ain't easy rearing a stubborn 20, 30, then 40 year-old psychotic infant in a society that denies everything. Thanks, especially, to Grandmother Anna Lou Callen Posey, always there, and Francois, for so much love.

Everyone named as an influence: for friendship, support, and raising the bar so high, anti-gravity boots became necessary. And especially:

- Jack Nuckols: giant of a human being and grand-elder. RIP.
- Willetta Warberg: who poured her heart and soul into me
- John Boyer: who fed me with so much of his _time_
- Purna Steinitz: who kept his terrible promise
- DeWaynn Rogers: who helped me up. RIP.

Each of you gave me the world.
