#### speaking

I edify audiences worldwide. Just pay my minimalist expenses plus something that fits your budget.

#### consulting

Get my advice on darkroom retreating, building darkrooms, and issues arising thereof. I will respond in detail, by phone or email, to all your questions and concerns about:

- how, where, and why to set up a darkroom
- how to organize a retreat with supporters
- how to deal with specific issues you have about retreating itself

My responses will be based on my experience. Over the past seven years, I have:

- done 15 retreats from 2-6 days long
- facilitated 25 retreats for others
- designed, built, and operated three working darkrooms (and several non-working ones)
- written 100,000 words about darkroom retreating for web, email, and print
- given 14 public talks

Write me about what you need help with.
