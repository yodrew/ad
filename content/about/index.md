### bio

Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, Mr Durham traveled America for 21 years searching for the cause of joy. He independently studied philosophy, health, and design. He tested his findings by living outside, doing odd jobs, playing music, and building alternative shelter. 

In 2008, his quest culminated in _the darkness conjecture_, a concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. He spent the next five years proving the concept, documenting his work at [andrewdurham.com](/), and building and operating darkrooms in Guatemala and Sweden. He writes, speaks, and consults on everything related to Hygienic darkroom retreating.
