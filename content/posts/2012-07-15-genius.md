One of my purposes with a solution to inordinate suffering is to solve "The Stupidity Problem" and restore natural human genius. Everyone has genius. It is yet another casualty of the stupidity-inducing civilizing process. But I have occasionally glimpsed it in myself and others. It is yet another of the gems to be recovered upon recovering full health, full sanity, full consciousness.

I am going to be a genius again. I am clearing the way for billions of people be geniuses again. We are going to live forever and do the same on a billion other planets suffering the same psychotic stupidity as we do here.

“Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.”  
 --Richard Buckminster Fuller
