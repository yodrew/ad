Hey, I just came across this excellent web-based credit clearing system:
[Community Exchange System][1] [EDIT: I no longer dig this system. It's popular but messy.] CES* is international, free, simple, compatible with paper systems, thorough, and cool.  It's just about what the godfather of new money, Thomas Greco, calls for in _[The End of Money and the Future of Civilization_, chapter 17][2].

Other worthy systems I've come across in the last couple days:
[payswarm.com][3] web technology-based, multiple-scenario payment system. Big vision.
[ opentransact.org][4] similar goals as payswarm, different architecture
[picomoney.com][5] clever, based on opentransact
[cyclos.org][6] open source software to run your own bank, complete with free hosting; soul boggling!
[villages.cc][7]**is the best implementation of [ripplepay.com][8], a compelling solution to LETS accountability concerns.
[e-flux.com/timebank][9] hip and simple
friendly [favors.org][10] 2nd largest after CES, social, clever, but aging and a bit complicated
[johnturmel.com/uniset.htm][11] very simple, start alone now. Improved by showing account as a ledger using a [web-based spreadsheet][12]
[JEU/GAME][13] paper system (compatible with CES), very elegant, semi-private, decentralized accounting, best for when the lights go out.

CES is (NOT*) the most accessible, practical, and mature, though some of these systems, especially payswarm, have much greater potential. Open source money has finally gotten legs, wings… and teeth.

*EDIT: I gave up on CES because of issues with its design and management. So I am exploring two other systems now: [Community Forge][14], based on Drupal Community Accounting/mutual credit module, and [Villages][7]. It's Ripple base is better, but CF is much more developed. The insides of it look great so far.  Open source, delegated authority and responsibility. Kind of a weak social network, but it is there.

Greco says a proper system needs:

  1. a marketplace
  2. a social network
  3. a means of payment
  4. a measure of value or pricing unit

Both have all four criteria. So it's a toss up for me. I hope Villages works out.

[complementaire-economie.startpagina.nl][15] huge list of currencies, systems, and software, some defunct
[ Open Transactions][16] open source digital cash, transmittable through tons of media, needing no third-party record keeper.

Two cool sites about money ideas:
[MetaCurrency][17]
[Webisteme][18] inventor of [#PunkMoney][19], a twitter-based currency. fricking brilliant.
