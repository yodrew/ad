On the [wish][1] to recover:


> There are two kinds of doing—automatic; and doing what you "wish". Take a small thing which you "wish" to do and cannot do and make this your God. Let nothing interfere. If you "wish", you can. Without wishing, you never "can". "Wish" is the most powerful thing in the world.
—G I Gurdjieff
