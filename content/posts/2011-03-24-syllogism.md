Here is my clearest articulation yet of the conjecture's chain of causation, in the form of a seven-line syllogism:

Suffering comes from a catastrophic injury to the psyche;
the psyche is a system of an organism;
organisms are self-healing;
healing requires vital energy;
vital energy accumulates during rest;
psychic rest is most profound in absolute darkness;
therefore, darkness is the solution to inordinate suffering.

[Note 1: See end of [basics][1] for updated version of this.]

[Note 2: I learned this is not a syllogism, just a regular old argument. Syllogisms have only three propositions.]
