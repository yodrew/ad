Just came across these three entries in Wikipedia about the strange light that people often experience in darkness retreats:


[Ganzfeld Effect][1], [Phosphene][2], [Prisoner's Cinema][3]

"Cinema" certainly coincides with my idea of the entertainment value of the light show in the dark. It is just the "hallucinations" that the Ganzfeld Effect entry describes.

But maybe hallucinations are not fabrications of consciousness after all. With enough time inside, I think it will become evident either way.
