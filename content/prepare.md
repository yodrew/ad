title: "prepare"
---

This is the registration form I have used with clients, followed by the menu and list of things to bring. Even if not retreating at a center, I suggest you read it and fill out the questionnaire to help you prepare mentally for the retreat. Likewise, pass it on to those you ever facilitate retreats for.

~~

Register for your retreat here. Follow instructions carefully.

#### general

- Read this book. Quiz later.
- Select dates for your retreat from the calendar below. Retreats begin at 18:00 and end at 12:00 four or eight mornings later. For example, a 4-day retreat that begins on Monday evening would end on Friday morning. And a retreat can begin the same day another ends.
- Respond [by email](/about/) to the questionnaire below. Responses of one or two sentences are sufficient.

#### menu 

Here is a Hygienic food plan:

- pure water on tap
- frugivorous menu
    - fresh fruit and leafy green vegetables (lettuce, celery, spinach, culinary herbs)
    - whole, raw, ripe, well-washed, and amply provided for eating anytime
    - green salad: sweet or savory, large, properly combined, served at midday
    - not served: oil, spices, salt, onions, garlic, ginger, or ferments (like vinegar).
- if you would like to know more about this menu before trying it, read the food sections in [hygiene](/hygiene/) and [protocol](/protocol/) and Dr Douglas Graham's _The 80/10/10 Diet_
- if this menu is unacceptable, eat as simply and naturally as you know how. For suggestions, write me with your limitations.

#### location

If you are thinking of turning a space into a darkroom, sleep there 2-3 nights beforehand. Is there anything about it that might disturb you and which you cannot practically change about it? Search your feelings. Will you feel comfortable there? If so, great. If not, keep looking. See introduction and notes of [design](/design/) chapter for more comments about this.

#### things to bring

- Yes:
    - bedsheets and pillow (let center know ahead of time if you need these provided)
    - pajamas/lounging clothes
    - sweater
    - slippers
    - enough water bottles to hold 3 liters
    - personal items
    - prescription medication
- No: 
    - cigarettes
    - electronic devices that make sound or light: computers, audio players, watches, clocks, etc
    - If you must bring any of these things, unless critical for your health, turn them off and store them during the retreat or ask to store them with your supporter.
    - contraband and alcohol: disallowed on the premises
- Optional 
    - cellphone for emergency use
    - special food or medicine
    - exercise equipment (yoga mat, weights, etc)
