#### mechanics

- _Do you eat in a retreat?_

    Yes. And food is always available.

- _How many people retreat at once?_

    One. The point of this retreat is to rest, heal, and recover oneself.

- _How do you do things in darkness?_

    Very slowly. And by getting familiar with the room and making memorable places for your belongings before it is darkened.

- _Could you retreat with a sleeping mask?_

    No. Masks are uncomfortable for a long period of time and eventually leak light. The skin has light receptors, so it would have to be covered all the time as well, even when eating, bathing, eliminating, etc. And a minimally furnished room is still required to eliminate dangers, distractions, and associations.
	
    So sleeping masks don't work for entire retreats. But they are good for travel, naps, and sleeping until your bedroom can be darkened.

- _Is it like meditation?_

    Yes and no. 

    Yes, because your attention, when awake and holding still, is generally on yourself, not your thoughts. No, because, in darkness, you keep it there with much greater ease and for a different purpose than in spiritual meditation.
 
    It is easier in darkness because of the intellect-calming physiological response to darkness. In a meditation retreat, the point of maintaining certain conditions is to meditate, to practice. In darkness, the point of the conditions, including meditation and exercise (!), is to rest. 
    
    Sometimes you can't rest. Hold on.

#### concerns

- _Wouldn't you go crazy staying in darkness that long?_

    No. You would only go crazy in darkness from being _forced_ to be there, as in prison. A retreat is a choice based on reason, and the door is always unlocked.

- _Do you get bored?_

    Yes, and it is a very good sign. Sometimes your autonomic self works on something so damaged, painful, and draining that the psyche has had to completely shut off feeling to it. It becomes an internal black hole. Boredom means you are approaching it and that recovery of a lost part of yourself is imminent.

#### objections

- _I could never do a darkroom retreat._

    At the moment, your doing a retreat is out of the question. You cannot do it if you don't want to, and you cannot want to if you don't know about it. So all that matters right now is whether you feel drawn to learn more about it.

- _Isn't total darkness unnatural? Wouldn't we normally be exposed to stars and moon at night?_

    Is shelter unnatural? Large uncovered windows are very recent in popular architecture. Most traditional shelter, civilized and indigenous, is dark or darkenable and regularly darkened.
    
    When people are in shock, exhausted, or emotionally overwhelmed, they instinctively seek shelter in solitude and cover their eyes with their hands. A darkroom retreat is merely an extended expression of this instinct in extreme cases. 
	
    Which are epidemic.

- _Darkness could be good for some people, but there are many ways people can heal their pain. Nothing works for everyone._
    
    This would mean that:
    
    - light does not interfere with deep sleep in some ill people
    - deep healing can occur without deep sleep
    - the human organism has no specific needs for healing from psychic trauma, despite its specific---and universal---need of rest for healing in all other cases (as well as its specific needs of air for breathing, light for seeing, food for eating, etc).
    
    Naturally, I disagree. Relativism makes fashionable philosophy but poor physiology.
