Darkness can be used in different formats for different reasons. Here, I describe the ones I've tried so you can immediately begin experiencing for yourself deep rest in darkness. Observe the effects in your energy level, psychic state, and general well-being.

These are in the order I recommend you do them in.

#### sleep in darkness tonight

Start like this: tack dark, dense blankets over your bedroom windows and doors to get relief _tonight_ from outdoor ambient light. Extend corners of the blanket as far past door on either side as possible. Turn off or cover any devices in your room that produce light. But make sure you have fresh air, even if it lets in a little light for now. Get a cheap sleeping mask from a travel store to make up some of the difference. 

We all know how it is to finally get enough sleep after too many short nights: we feel tired afterward. This is not getting too much sleep (a physiological impossibility). We are just tapping into the first layer of a backlog of lost sleep. Feeling groggy is the first phase of catching up, which can take days. Reversing sleep deprivation is like withdrawing from a drug.

Once you're "sober", you can see if you really like darkness for sleeping nightly. If so, [make](/make/) removable inserts and lightproof vents so your room is dark, fresh, _and_ easily reopened to light during the day.

#### 4-day retreat

Everyone interested in a 4-day retreat can try one. Though not guaranteed, it is possible to catch up on all the sleep one ever lost in darkness in about 48 hours. The amount of deep sleep to be had in this short amount of time is hard to imagine until you experience it. 

It is best to go into darkness at night and come out three mornings later, making the dark part of the retreat 2.5 days. Before or after a 48 hour period, you have to sleep the night anyway. It's good to have a whole day awake before and after a retreat. And it's good to have time to spare. 

After sleeping as much as possible, eating, eliminating, and bathing, what do you do in darkness without work, people, or media? I have found exercise and meditation to be helpful in continuing to rest while awake. I explain more about this in the section on attention in the [protocol](/protocol/) chapter.

Spend a minimum of 15 minutes relighting the room by opening the window inserts bit by bit so you can slowly re-adjust to light. This is very important.

It takes time to properly readjust to light and ordinary life. So a period of unstressed transition back to it is critical. For every three days of darkness, allow at least 24 hours of continued rest, except with windows uncovered during the day.

Hormones are rebalancing and this takes time. It certainly feels like a chemical process. Strangely, the sense of balance can be affected. It takes time to take account of what just happened with yourself in darkness, to begin integrating the changes, extra energy, and value of the retreat to you. 

Spend the transition quietly. Visit with no one. Take a slow walk. Take a nap (covering the windows if you like). Lie on the grass or the sofa. Then cover the windows at sunset and sleep the night again in darkness.

Uncover the windows when you awaken. Your supporter should come at 10:00 to make sure you are up. Consider your retreat finished by noon at the latest.

Ease back into your regular life, where you will likely continue to notice changes.

A regular, fully-functioning house is best for a first 4-day retreat. But rent a retreat cabin if necessary and improvise a bathroom. For this short of a period, running water is unnecessary. See the "bathroom" section of [make](/make/) for a short list of requirements.

#### 8-day retreat

This is the most beneficial retreat I have experienced myself. Most people who can retreat for four days can go eight days and benefit more than twice as much. This is because the organism's response to darkness is cumulative, so the healing process deepens over time. Many of my early clients felt like they were just beginning to get somewhere when their 4-day retreat ended. So I added 8-day retreats for first-timers, and it worked fine.

This is like the 4-day retreat except:

- a major psychic issue can arise after physical restedness is reached
- another cycle of emotional discomfort and resolution usually occurs with that
- two days of transition are needed afterward
- a bathing facility is needed for emotional as well as physical reasons. See "bathroom" section of [make](/make/) for how to make a portable indoor shower.
- cover and uncover the windows each evening (by 20:00) and morning (by 10:00). Also do it for naps if you like.

So only go four days if eight feels like too much, or you haven't time or the facility. Trust your feeling about this. Life and healing move slowly; so can you, now that you have found a realistic way to heal.

#### sleep in darkness nightly

From simply darkening his bedroom, a friend reported to me a huge difference in the quality of sleep he and his mate experienced, as well as a return of vivid dreams. I have experienced the same thing whenever I have been able to darken the room I sleep in. As a rule, the darker the room, the better the sleep. And perfect darkness is qualitatively better than near-darkness. See for yourself.

It is best to go to sleep early, 20:00 at the latest. Then one naturally awakens around 02:00. At this hour, one is freshly rested, the promise of sleep lies ahead, and the mind and its inhibitions are slightly out of commission. So sex can be especially gratifying.

It is also considered the most auspicious hour for meditating. Creative thinking, exercising, or eating fruit are all fine, too. Sometimes I turn on the light to clean, design, read, or write for an hour or two. Then I go back to bed till 08:00 (give or take a couple hours). Before widespread public lighting, this was a common sleeping pattern. It's called biphasic or [segmented sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmented_sleep).

#### mini-retreat

This is for maintenance of restedness while keeping to your regular schedule. It is the same as sleeping nightly in darkness (see above), except for two things: it is not just best, but **mandatory** to go to bed before 20:00 and leave darkness no more than 14 hours later*. And when I awaken around 02:00, whatever else I do, I remain in darkness. 

A mini-retreat is not as impressive as regular ones. But it is safe, it feels really good, and it doesn't disrupt one's schedule.

*CAUTION: Do _not_ start a mini-retreat late and sleep extra late. This is the one dangerous way I found to use darkness. Read my blog post, [how not to retreat](/blog/2013/05/how-not-to-retreat/), for an explanation.

#### future

The benefit of short retreats is clearly limited. Doing a lot of them does not equal doing few long ones. It's the law of diminishing returns combined with the risk of bolstering the ego and the frustration of glimpsed but unrealized potential.

My goal is to retreat for 20 days (5 lit). In my second successful retreat I had a hunch that in two weeks of darkness my psyche will heal from trauma at the core, enabling me to put the rest of my life back together afterward.

[Stories persist](/reports/365-day-retreat-of-150-year-old-yogi/) of astonishing physical healing occurring in Ayurvedic darkroom retreats lasting 3-12 months: growing new teeth (!); recovering lost hair and eyesight; and healing from diabetes and even signs of old age. It seems worth looking into.

I would like to find a way health, including psychic health, can be fully restored in one shot. Like healing a broken bone. To this end, I would like to see Hygienic retreat centers worldwide with facilities and support for:

- darkroom retreats
- fasts (a la [Mosseri](http://rawfoodconsultations.com/))
- physical retraining
- training in healthy lifeway, including both lifestyle and livelihood
- open source research and development of the above
- a village residence for staff where all this gets applied and tested in real life

In 3-6 months, one would be:

- restored to as much function and vitality as possible
- prepared to maintain it in daily life
- prepared to deal with the residue of the past. 

As a consultant, I wish to help developers of such centers as well as places just for darkroom retreats. I also wish to help operators of existing retreat centers include Hygienic darkroom retreating in their programs. Those who support it become eligible for my future network, through which I can refer clients to you. Write me for more info.

It will take generations of healthy living for our full potential as human beings to be restored to original levels, but huge strides can be made in our lifetimes.

#### conclusion

Now that we have examined different formats of the restful use of darkness for different purposes, let's think ahead about what to do in a Hygienic darkroom retreat.
