This is a book of natural psychology. It shows how physical darkness is to the psyche what a mother is to a child: origin, sustenance, and refuge. How psychic illness and trauma, like a scraped knee, can heal itself. Without substances, treatment, or therapists; without loads of money, knowledge, skill, effort, or time; and without discipline, rituals, or practices. Just restored normal conditions.

This book offers hope to sufferers of all kinds. It calls Natural Hygiene, a timeless system of primarily bodily health, to also serve the soul. It disspells the pall of fear around darkness and extricates it from historically esoteric use.

#### why retreat

- for the great pleasure of resting deeply
- for relief from the distress and malstimulation of civilized existence
- to recover from exhaustion
- to heal from psychic trauma and illness
- to finally deal with one's own suffering

#### history

Every civilized spiritual tradition and many indigenous ones have used darkness for thousands of years as the ultimate environment for self-discipline and to gain unusual knowledge: ancient Egyptians and Maya in their pyramids; Christians in catacombs; Sufis and Taoists in caves; Tibetan Buddhists in cells of monasteries.

Western science has studied sensory destimulation since the 1950s for applications including space and health. Ayurveda, an East Indian healing tradition, uses extended periods of darkness for rejuvenation. By report, it is the fountain of youth. 

Amazonian shamanism uses darkness in ayahuasca ceremony. Welsh shamans and Navajo, Maya, and Kogi Indians alike hold darkness in high regard as essential to self-discovery. 

Hygienic darkroom retreating completely secularizes the use of darkness for the specific purpose of healing, of _self-recovery_. There is nothing mystical, disciplined, or complicated about this approach. It is rational, restful, and safe.

#### background

##### finn

I first heard about dark retreating in 2004 from my then-spiritual teacher. From a Hindu tradition, he had heard about its use in Ayurveda. "I don't know, but apparently, after a few weeks of it, one comes out completely renewed," he told me.

I found this very strange. I thought what people need is more light. But like a lot of things he said, the idea of darkness stayed with me.

Then in 2005, I was talking to an old Oregon hippy-from-birth. Name of Finn Po. Scrawny guy, lots of energy, gently jokes about people's hang-ups, and is incredibly helpful. Drinks his own pee and lives in a tiny geodesic dome he built out of garbage 20 years ago. Naturally, Finn had a darkroom. 

"Tired of enlightenment?" he asked. "Try endarkenment."

I said, "Ohmigod, Finn, really?!"

"It's the way of the future. Don't be the last to know."

"What's it like?"

Arms wrapped round himself, he said, "It's a _luxury_." 

"How do you do it?"

"Just git in the room!" 

A benevolent Pied Piper, all the young people around tried it. After listening to him rhapsodize about it all winter, I did, too.

Wow.

But as Finn likes to say, I was just getting started. It would take two more years, the massive shock of leaving my teacher, and another successful retreat for me to grasp the significance of retreating in darkness.

How did all this begin?

At 15, I was overcome by [rapture](/darkness-conjecture/rapture/): sublime joy in perceiving a perfect, beautiful universe. This feeling and perspective lasted three months solid. When it faded, so did my conventional interests. I wanted more than anything to understand the cause of rapture. Living out of a [backpack](http://mchalepacks.com), I independently investigated this mystery for 21 years, experimenting with philosophy, health, and design. My darkroom retreats came toward the end of that period. Soon after, in late 2008, my solution came:

>_A slight increase of vital energy from adolescence had caused a temporary, partial restoration of my damaged psychic integrity, revealing an enrapturing universe. So perhaps a massive increase from darkroom retreating could cause permanent and complete restoration._

With this breakthrough, my search ended and my work began. I and 25 clients have tried it. Over the course of my 16 retreats, noticeable restoration of my psychic integrity and function has occurred. No data contradicting the basic idea has yet emerged. Now, an internationally recognized psychology professor unqualifiedly agrees with my theory and wants to do research on my exact method. 

What else can go right?

#### how it works

1. The psyche is self-healing because it is a system of an organism.
2. The primary condition of healing is rest because:
    - Healing requires the extra energy accumulated in rest.
    - Full healing only occurs in faculties at rest.
3. The psyche rests profoundly in darkroom retreat because:
    - A retreat provides all conditions of profound rest: comfort, solitude, time, and silence; absolute darkness, fresh air, warmth, and natural food.
    - Darkness signals us physiologically, through our circadian system, to sleep, dream, and lose appetite. In extended total darkness, sleep gets deeper and longer; waking consciousness more placid.
    - Sensation uses significant psychic energy. Vision requires more than all other senses combined.
    - The abstract nature of vision stimulates the mind. In darkness, the mind slows down. One can stop thinking and fall asleep more easily. When awake, the thinking, feeling, and moving modes of consciousness equalize in capacity and workload.
    
Because the process of healing is involuntary, it is foolproof. Darkness works the same for everyone, just as air for breathing and light for seeing. If nothing happens, conditions were insufficiently met. This book describes conditions and how to meet them.

#### terminology

**Hygiene** (capitalized): Natural Hygiene  
**psyche:** the faculty of consciousness (including the subconscious and unconscious). The soul.  
**normal:** what is biologically _appropriate_ (not merely usual or average)  
**psychic:** of or relating to the psyche. For example, I refer to psychic illness rather than "mental" illness. Psychology is not just the study of the mind, but the psyche: the _entirety_ of human consciousness. This includes its emotional and physical forms, not just its mental ones. Also, I am not talking about occult phenomena.  
**lifeway:** way of life. It is everything that happens with a group of people in the course of living. I once used the word, culture, for this. Then I learned culture is recent: an invention of civilization. I wanted a bigger word which would include all approaches to human existence. Lifeway is a nicely compressed term common in anthropology.

#### darkroom

A dedicated Hygienic darkroom is just a small, fully functional house in a quiet location. It has minimal furnishings, like a hotel room. Like all houses should be but are not, it is perfectly and easily darkened.

- It is so dark that even after your eyes adjust to it for three days, you still cannot see your hand in front of your face. 
- When you look around, you cannot see a haze or pinprick of light anywhere. 
- And inside, there are no light sources like candles.

Temporary darkrooms for shorter retreats can be anywhere you feel you will be comfortable enough.

#### what is Natural Hygiene?

A philosophy of health, Natural Hygiene originated in America a generation after the revolution. It became a mass movement in 1832, lasting to the current day, with the lectures of Sylvester Graham, physiologist and father of the Graham cracker. Natural Hygiene bears unswerving respect for life's self-preserving nature, and for the self's primarily autonomic, secondarily volitional nature. It observes that health naturally occurs in organisms under normal conditions of life. So it studies and provides them. 

These conditions include fresh air, simple clothing, natural food, and cleanliness by regular bathing. Hygiene taught the modern world the enormous benefits of these, making Hygiene the most influential approach to health in the world. Its motto: "Health through healthful living".

Hygiene identifies disease **_as_** the process of healing. Disease is the normal organic activity of self-repair, cleaning, and re-energizing, but under abnormal conditions. Thus, disease is not an invading entity to be fought, but a natural process to support with healthy conditions and practices.

Natural Hygiene, which could be called applied physiology, has extensive means of caring for the physical human. But it has lacked a psychology. I will show how, in darkness, a Hygienic way has emerged to care for the psyche.

The fundamentals of Natural Hygiene help us reconnect with our own common sense about healing. They guide us past incorrect assumptions and associations we may have with it. Once you have these absolute basics down, you can learn the concrete details of a darkroom retreat and approach it with confidence. After retreating, Natural Hygiene provides guidance in all aspects of healthful living.

#### audience

This book is for those who suffer in any way---spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, socially, or ecologically---and need hope that their suffering is not necessarily permanent. It is for self-explorers and appreciators of good arguments.

Darkroom retreating is for anyone to whom it makes sense and who feels moved to do it, whether to heal from acute illness or to simply try it. Besides psychic illness, much physical illness is psychosomatic and therefore amenable to self-healing in darkness. 

However, darkness is no escape. Sometimes illness needs to be addressed in other obvious ways first. But just knowing about darkroom retreating can encourage us to do so. And acquaintance with Hygienic principles is invaluable to healing from any illness.

#### how to use this book

If you find sufficient reason here to retreat, then simply decide:

1. what kind of retreat to do
2. when to do it
3. where to do it
