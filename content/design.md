These are my specifications for the design of a dedicated Hygienic darkroom retreat facility. It is a deluxe model for commercial use and long retreats. 
You can forgo or improvise many specifications when first trying darkness, for short retreats, and for occasional use. The shorter the retreat, the less you need. See [format](/format) and [make](/make) chapters for budget building tips. 

It is best to start with a small fully functional house in a quiet location. Fully functional means it has heating, ventilation, running water, and electricity. But what is acceptable depends on what you are comfortable with. If you can sleep reasonably well in a location and feel no problems with doing a short retreat, then try rather than wait for an ideal location.

All my retreats have succeeded or failed primarily because of how well the darkroom itself worked. Do not tolerate too much stale air, frequent noise, light leaks, dangers, discomforts, poor food, etc. At some point, stress becomes distress and destroys your retreat. Or worse, due to your conditioning, you may not even notice these hindrances. But your body and soul will. You will be left wondering why your retreat was not as beneficial as I said it could be. 

You should be able to turn off the light and let go of all such concerns. The stress of healing is quite enough for anyone to bear. A retreat is not punishment or strife. It is sanctuary for resting and recuperating from a lifeway characterized by strife. 

Success of a retreat depends on several factors including attitude, protocol, preparation, and support. The facility is the final piece of the puzzle. Good design can build many conditions into the room, making retreats practically foolproof. The better the darkroom, the more effective your retreat will be. There is no penalty for doing things correctly.

That said, maybe you cannot, for whatever reason, do everything correctly. Then you do your best. If we could already do everything correctly, we would likely have no need of darkroom retreating.

Natural Hygiene uses only normal conditions, so these specifications only include what a good shelter would. So this is not just the design of a darkroom, but a healthy house as well.

#### notes

**1: noise** Others inevitably make noise. Even if they manage to be perfectly quiet, they can hear you. What if, like me, you have to scream and cry? It's nobody's business and they should not be burdened with it. Even if you don't make noise, you will _know_ the person is there. It will influence a process that should be free. In short, any contact with people should be brief and intentional, not incidental. Fortunately, people aren't going anywhere and you can rejoin their company when you finish. 

A clear exception is if you are a mother of a child who still needs your presence. The child can be with you in darkness as long as you both like. I have never facilitated such a retreat, but I definitely would, and this is what I would say. I support [attachment](http://continuum-concept-org). 

The weirdest thing that happened to me with regards to noise was in an apartment building. I kept waking up exhausted from hundreds of short, meaningless dreams. After days of this, I realized I was dreaming others' mind chatter. I'm distinctly non-"psychic"; this never happened to me before. But I am sensitive. A canary in a coalmine. When something goes wrong, I notice.

Two years later, in December, 2013, I was in another apartment building where I felt comfortable and could sleep and dream easily. It had partly to do with my sympathetic host. When I retreated there, I could feel others' presence in the building, but their thoughts did not invade my dreams. So it comes down to how comfortable one is in a given spot for whatever one intends. I would not have done a long retreat there, but the short one I did may have saved my life.

The worst noise comes from the grinding relentlessness of machines, like a drill to the skull. The larger the building, the more electrical wiring, steel framing, and reinforcement it has, the more it electromagnetically disturbs us. Finally, there is wireless radiation, that planet-size microwave oven we now live inside of. Fortunately, it decreases in intensity by a square of the distance from it. So the worst of it is avoidable.
	
One becomes so vulnerable in profound rest that the wrong setting can be harmful, as in [my case](/blog/2011/12/5-day-retreat/). Avoid retreating in large or occupied buildings unless it is an emergency or you have no options. 

**2: roundness** Round buildings shield occupants from subtle energy, physical and psychical. It flows around or through them because roundness does not resist or capture it.

By contrast, a rectilinear building, due to the nature of the right angle, stops movement: of people, energy, and things. This stagnation saps and poisons occupants. Rectilinear buildings can be temporarily used for retreats, but first they should be remedied with Feng Shui or Vastuveda. Long term, they are unhealthy and limited in their benefit. Replace and dismantle them as soon as possible.

Roundness is so important, I will only endorse darkrooms made with existing rectilinear buildings for their first five years, and newly constructed darkrooms if they are round or have five or more sides joined at equal, obtuse angles. Rectangular walls and right angles where floor meets walls are fine, but not a rectlinear floor plan. 
    
Obviously, all buildings will not become round overnight. My priority is those where we rest and heal. Elegant, cheap, quick [shelter designs](/other-writings/links/) are available.
